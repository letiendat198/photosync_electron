# Photosync Electron (WIP)

Backup images and videos from PC to Google Photos without using Google's clunky Drive Client 

This is a rework of my old project [PhotoSync](https://www.github.com/letiendat198/Photosync), which was written in Rust and lack a GUI. It's also quite inconvenient. It has bugged me for long enough so now here we are.

Also to learn some React and JS/TS (Which is rough. Why tsc transpile to mjs and still use require() then complain about it? Does it hate me? Is it trying to shoot itself in the foot? Skill issues? Why vite-plugin-electron hide a crucial piece of document in a freaking command inside their source file that took me hours to find? No one knows)

## Features
- Backup images and videos to Google Photos
- Allow choosing which folder to backup
- Convenient ON/OFF toogle in system tray
- Custom backup notification (Maybe?) 

## TODO
- Very early stage. A lot of work

## Known Issues
- Will add when the dust has settled
